# DevSwipe

**Tagline:**  
Swipe right on projects, collaborators, and opportunities. Left on bugs. üêû

## Project Overview

**DevSwipe** is a Tinder-inspired platform built with the **MERN stack** ‚Äî MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js ‚Äî tailored specifically for full-stack developers. It lets you discover new projects, collaborators, and opportunities through a familiar swiping interface. Swipe right if you're interested, left if it's a no-go.

This project demonstrates how to build a modern full-stack Tinder-like app, covering everything from architecture design to implementing features such as user authentication, swipeable cards, matchmaking, and real-time chat using WebSockets.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT and password hashing  
- Swipe cards UI to browse projects and collaborators  
- Matchmaking when two users swipe right on each other  
- Real-time chat for matched users powered by Socket.io  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- Developer-centric profiles showcasing skills and projects

## MERN Stack Tech Overview

| Layer       | Technology           | Purpose                               |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Frontend    | React.js             | UI components, swipe gestures        |
| Backend API | Node.js + Express.js | RESTful API, authentication          |
| Database    | MongoDB + Mongoose   | Data storage for users, matches, chats |
| Real-time   | Socket.io            | WebSocket-based real-time chat       |

## Architecture

- React frontend communicates with Express API backend  
- MongoDB stores user profiles, swipes, matches, chat history  
- Socket.io integrated with Express backend for real-time messaging

- npm or yarn  
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)  
- Git  

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devswipe.git
cd devswipe

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
# Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with:
# MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
# PORT=5000
npm run dev
